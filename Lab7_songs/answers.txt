If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:

Their audio aura would depend on the energy, valence, and danceability of the songs they listened to.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:

We are only taking the average of their top 100 songs, but people listen to way more than 100 songs in a year.
